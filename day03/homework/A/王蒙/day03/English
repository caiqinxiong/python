Python is a programming language made by Guido van Rossum in 1991
The powerful and extensible programming language is categorized as dynamically typed,
garbage collection general-purpose high-level and interpreted It is designed for code
readability with compatibility with the off-side rule or significant whitespace
Developers can use its constructs for clearer programming at smaller or larger scales
Python is compatible with multiple programming paradigms. This includes programmings that are procedural,
object-oriented and functional The programming language comes with a standard library called batteries included
All programs made from Python runs on any platform through Python interpreters
There is no need for reconfiguring the entire code to make it work in all platforms
Everything developed under Python is managed by Python Software Foundation The Python development community
hosts the free reference implementation and development model CPython
